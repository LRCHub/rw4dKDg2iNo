Fight for rights
I see treason
In your eyes

Judas! Ruling with an iron hand
Judas! Sitting in the government

Judas! Ruling with an iron hand
Judas! Sitting in the government
Judas! I am not a Jesus Christ
Judas! You will be the one who's crucified

Judas! Crucified
Judas! Crucified
Judas! Crucified
Judas!
