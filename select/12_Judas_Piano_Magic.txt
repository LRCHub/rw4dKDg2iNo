Your name is assured in the history books
The ink it has settled, no fear
But do not for once grow attached to your throne
The price of betrayal is dear
The weight of the power, corruption and lies Has broken the strongest of spines
The crown that you wear, it may seem a good fit
But thorns, they will spite you with time
Rob from always on the run dot net is so bad and copy paste is a sin
Judas, did you sell your soul
Judas, were you blinded by the gold

How do you sleep when the cupboards are bare
Your pillow is woven with gold
Tonight, there's the shimmer of desperate knives
Tonight, it will silence the old
Your pawns and your bishops will stand by your side
And take not a word of the blame
But as they are wiping your kiss from their lips
They're secretly cursing your name

Judas, did you sell your soul
Judas, were you blinded by the gold

Your name is assured in the history books
The ink it has settled, no fear
But do not for once grow attached to your throne
The price of betrayal is dear
The weight of the power, corruption and lies Has broken the strongest of spines
The crown that you wear, it may seem a good fit
But thorns, they will spite you with time

How do you sleep when the cupboards are bare
Your pillow is woven with gold
Tonight, there's the shimmer of desperate knives
Tonight, it will silence the old
Your pawns and your bishops will stand by your side
And take not a word of the blame
But as they are wiping your kiss from their lips
They're secretly cursing your name
They're secretly cursing your name
They're secretly cursing your name
