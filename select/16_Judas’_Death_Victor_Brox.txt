My God! I saw him - he looked three-quarters dead!
And he was so bad I had to turn my head
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame
And I know who everybody's gonna blame
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good
I'd save him all this suffering if I could!
Don't believe ... our good ... save him ... if I could

Cut the confessions, forget the excuses
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance
The mob turned against him - you backed the right horse

What you have done will be the saving of Israel
You'll be remembered forever for this
And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts
Prettly good wages for one little kiss

Christ! I know you can't hear me
But I only did what you wanted me to
Christ! I'd sell out the nation
For I have been saddled with the murder of you
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime
And the slime and the slime and the mud!

I don't know how to love him
I don't know why he moves me
He's a man - he's just a man
He's not a king - he's just the same
As anyone I know
He scares me so
When he's cold and dead, will he let me be?
Does he love me too? Does he care for me?

My mind is in darkness now - my God, I am sick! I've been used!
And you knew all the time!
God! I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime
Your foul, bloody crime!
You have murdered me! You have murdered me!

Poor old Judas
So long, Judas
