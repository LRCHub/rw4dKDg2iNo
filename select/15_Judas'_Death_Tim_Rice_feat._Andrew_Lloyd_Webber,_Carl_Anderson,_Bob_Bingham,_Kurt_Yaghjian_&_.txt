My God, I saw him
He looked three-quarters dead
And he was so bad
I had to turn my head
You beat him so hard
That he was bent and lame
And I know who everybody's
Going to blame
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good
I'd save him all the suffering
If I could
Don't believe
Our good
Save him
If I could

Cut the confessions
Forget the excuses
I don't understand why
You're filled with remorse
All that you've said
Has come true with a vengence
The mob has turned against him
You've backed the right horse

What you have done
Will be the saving of Israel
You'll be remembered forever
For this
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts
Pretty good wages
For one little kiss

Christ! I know you can't hear me
But I only did what you wanted me to
Christ! I'd sell out the nation
For I have been saddled
With the murder of you
I have been spattered
With innocent blood
I should be dragged
Through the slime and the mud
I have been spattered
With innocent blood
I should be dragged
Through the slime and the mud

I don't know how to love him
I don't know why he moves me

He's a man
He's just a man
He's not a king
He's just the same
As anyone I know
He scares me so!
When he's cold and dead
Will he let me be?
Does he love me too?
Does he care for me?
Ohhhhh...

My mind is darkness now

My god I am sick
I've been used
And you knew
All the time
God I'll never ever know
Why you chose me for your crime
For your foul bloody crime
You have murdered me!
You have murdered me!

So long, Judas Poor old Judas
